        Following the successful landing of Chandrayaan-3 and its commencement
        of lunar studies, ISRO is now embarking on an exploration mission to
        investigate the Sun's surface. ISRO has launched the PSLV Rocket from
        SriHarikota, Andhrs Pradesh, India at 11.50 am on 2nd September, 2023.
        The rocket will reach the Lagrange point L1 after about four months and
        will conduct its study from this point. In Hindi, "Aditya" is synonymous
        with the sun. On September 2 at 11:50 a.m., the launch of Aditya L1 is
        scheduled from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The
        primary objective of the Aditya L1 mission is to scrutinize the sun's
        surface and gather valuable data to enhance our understanding of solar
        phenomena.

        The following are the main science aims of India’s first solar mission:
        1. Studying the Solar Corona One of the primary objectives of the
        Aditya-L1 mission is to study the Sun’s outer atmosphere, known as the
        solar corona. The corona is an enigmatic region that extends millions of
        kilometers into space and is visible during a total solar eclipse.
        Understanding the solar corona is crucial because it plays a significant
        role in the solar wind, the continuous flow of charged particles from
        the Sun that affects the space environment around the Earth and other
        planets. 2. Investigating Solar Magnetic Fields The Sun’s magnetic field
        is intricately linked to various solar phenomena, including sunspots,
        solar flares, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These phenomena can
        have a profound impact on space weather, potentially disrupting
        satellite communication, power grids, and navigation systems on Earth.
        The Aditya-L1 mission aims to examine the Sun’s magnetic field with
        greater precision and detail, helping scientists develop improved models
        for predicting solar activity and its effects on our
        technology-dependent society. 3. Understanding Solar Eruptions and
        Flares Solar flares and CMEs are explosive events that release immense
        amounts of energy and charged particles into space. They can generate
        intense bursts of X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, and high-energy
        particles, posing a threat to space missions, astronauts, and even
        satellites in orbit. Aditya-L1 seeks to study these solar eruptions,
        unraveling their underlying mechanisms and enhancing our ability to
        forecast their occurrence and potential impacts on space infrastructure.
        4. Investigating the Solar Photosphere The solar photosphere is the
        visible surface of the Sun, and it is where most of the solar radiation
        we receive on Earth originates. Studying the photosphere in detail helps
        scientists better understand the Sun’s energy generation processes, the
        mechanisms driving its constant activity, and its influence on Earth’s
        climate and weather patterns. Aditya-L1 will provide valuable data to
        improve our knowledge of the Sun’s fundamental processes. 5. Monitoring
        Solar Variability The Sun’s activity is not constant but undergoes
        cycles of varying intensity, known as the solar cycle. The solar cycle
        typically lasts around 11 years and has a direct impact on space weather
        and the Earth’s climate.
